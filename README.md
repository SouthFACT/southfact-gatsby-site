# Southern Forest Area Change Tool (SouthFACT) Gatsby Site

## First iteration of basic gatsby site

Once you have done your development work run the following to deploy to gh-pages
```
npm run deploy
```

Then navigate to the /map directory on gh-pages branch and upload the dist folder from https://github.com/SouthFACT/southfact-map-v2/tree/master/dist

This is a bit annoying right now but it's what we have.
